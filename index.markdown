Hi, I'm Eli. I'm a software developer.

I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020 with a degree in computer science and worked at Robinhood for about three years in the infra space, focusing on compute infrastructure management and efficiency.
As I further my career, I want to focus on renewable energy and climate solutions.

In my free time, I love to rock climb, mountain bike, ski, backpack, and cook.

In college, I worked on PSL-GWAS, a novel microbial GWAS method that utilizes statistical relational learning
to predict genetic causes of bacterial phenotypes. You can view the [source code](https://github.com/elip12/psl-gwas) and the [docs](https://psl-gwas.readthedocs.io). I also assisted with economics research at UCSC's [LEEPS Lab](https://econlab.ucsc.edu/public/).
