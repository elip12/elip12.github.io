Hi, I'm Eli. I'm a software developer.

I graduated from UC Santa Cruz in 2020 with a degree in computer science. I currently work at Robinhood.
I'm interested in research in bioinformatics and computational economics.

I'm currently working on PSL-GWAS, a novel microbial GWAS method that utilizes statistical relational learning
to predict genetic causes of bacterial phenotypes. You can view the [source code](https://github.com/elip12/psl-gwas) and the [docs](https://psl-gwas.readthedocs.io).

During my undergrad, I assisted with economics research with UCSC's [LEEPS Lab](https://econlab.ucsc.edu/public/).

You can view my [github](https://github.com/elip12), [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/eli-pandolfo), and [resume](/resume).
